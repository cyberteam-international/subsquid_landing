                                    <p>Certain recipients may be located in Switzerland, but they may be located in any country in the world. In particular, you should expect your data to be transferred to other countries in Europe and the USA where our service providers (such as Inuit Inc., Hotjar Ltd., Amplitude Inc., Google Ireland) are located. Our servers are located in Germany (providers: Google Cloud EMEA Limited and Hetzner Online GmbH), which provides adequate protection under art. 16 para. 1 revDPA.</p>
                                    <p>As we have explained in Section 8, we disclose data to other parties, not all of them are located in Switzerland. Your data may be processed in the European Economic Area (EEA) and in exceptional circumstances also in countries outside the EEA and around the world, which includes countries that do not provide the same level of data protection as Switzerland or the EEA and are not recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection. We only transfer data to these countries when it is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the exercise or defence of legal claims, or if such transfer is based on your explicit consent or subject to safeguards that assure the protection of your data, such as the European Commission approved standard contractual clauses.</p>

Personal data may be retained for as long as claims may be asserted against us, or if we are otherwise legally obliged to do so, or if legitimate business interests require further retention (e.g. for evidence and documentation purposes). At the end of the applicable retention period, we will securely destroy your information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Generally, shorter retention periods of no more than twelve months apply to operational data (e.g. system logs).</p>
